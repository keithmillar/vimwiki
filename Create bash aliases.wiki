The alias command can be quite useful for creating handy shortcuts and save you
some typing. It has this general syntax:

General alias syntax<br>
alias name='command'

Where 'name' is the alias name and command is any valid shell command. If you
want your aliases to be persistant then put them in your ~/.bashrc file.

For example, you can create some handy shortcuts for apt-get:

Alias for apt-get <br>
alias install='sudo apt-get install' <br>
alias addrepo='sudo apt-add-repository'<br>
alias remove='sudo apt-get remove'<br>
alias autoremove='sudo apt-get autoremove'<br>
alias update='sudo apt-get update'<br>
alias upgrade='sudo apt-get upgrade'<br>
alias distupgrade='sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'<br>

alias sshuttle='/usr/sbin/sshuttle -r ben@keithnflo.homelinux.com 0/0'

Restart your shell and you should be good to go!

 Now you can simply type install firefox instead of sudo apt-get install firefox.

It is a common practice to put all your aliases in a separate file and then load
that file into your .bashrc. The way to do this is to copy all the aliases to
another file say, .bash_aliases.

 Then, edit your .bashrc file and add the following code:

	include .bash_aliases if it exists<br>
 	if [ -f "$HOME/.bash_aliases" ]; then<br>
     ."$HOME/.bash_aliases"<br>
     	fi<br>

Inform the shell of these changes by executing the command: exec $SHELL

NOTE

If you are on Ubuntu, you do not have to edit the .bashrc file;
.bash_aliases will be already included for you.
