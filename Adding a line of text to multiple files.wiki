I have a bunch of files in a directory, and I need to insert a line of text into each of them. They have essentially the following format:
 {{{
 ---
 date: 2011-05-19
 layout: post
 title: Preparations
 category: blog
 tags:
  - cycling
 ---
 }}}
 And I'd like to insert author: Flo before the tags:

 for i in ; do sed -i 's/tags:/author: Flo\ntags:/' "i"; done
