Removes space and insert -
If you don't have rename or prefer to use just the shell:

for f in *\ *; do mv "$f" "${f// /-}"; done

Broken down:

 *\ * selects all files with a space in their name as input for the the for loop.
 The quotes around "$f" are important because we know there's a space in the filename and otherwise it would appear as 2+ arguments to mv.
 ${f//str/new_str} is a bash-specific string substitution feature. All instances of str are replaced with new_str.
