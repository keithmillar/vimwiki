=== how to delete all commit history in github ===

Deleting the .git folder may cause problems in your git repository. If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, it is very safe to do it as in the following:

    Checkout

    git checkout --orphan latest_branch

    Add all the files

    git add -A

    Commit the changes

    git commit -am "commit message"

    Delete the branch

    git branch -D master

    Rename the current branch to master

    git branch -m master

    Finally, force update your repository

    git push -f origin master
