I do not have a root password for many of the servers I interact with so I can not SSH directly in as the root user. Also, the ssh daemons are wisely configured with ‘PermitRootLogin’ set to ‘no’ so a password would be moot anyway. I do have sudo permissions on the servers so I can connect under my username and sudo the privileged commands as needed. Glazed-eye screen-staring started when I needed to rsync a remote directory that was read-only for root. How do I get rsync to run under sudo on the remote server? I did some searching and here are some options I found.

Option 1. Set NOPASSWD in the /etc/sudoers file.
crashingdaily ALL= NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/rsync

Then use the --rsync-path option to specify the sudo wrapper.
rsync -a -e "ssh" --rsync-path="sudo rsync" crashingdaily@server.remotehost.com:/u02/data_pump_dir/ /archive

rsync -avzP --delete -e ssh --rsync-path="sudo rsync" source_directory user@server_IP:path_destination_directory
