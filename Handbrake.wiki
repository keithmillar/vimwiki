==== Handbrake ====

Tutorial on how Rip / Copy DVDs in Ubuntu using HandBrake.
HandBrake is a very fast multithreaded cross•platform Transcoder available for
Linux, Mac and Windows.
Its primary purpose isn‘t to Rip DVDs. Its one of the best Transcoders available
that just happens to be able to copy encrypted DVDs (as long as you have
decrypting software such as libdvdcss2 installed).

Installation instructions for libdvdcss2 are detailed below.

Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10, 11.04:
sudo apt•get install ubuntu-restricted-extras libdvdread4
sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh

   Windows
Software that can play DVDs rely on dll files to tell it how to read the
encrypted disc for playback. In most free software, a common dll file called
libdvdcss is used. By using libdvdcss combined with HandBrake, we will be able
to decrypt our DVDs while we transcode, without any additional software.
and copy the libdvdcss•2.dll file to the HankBrake installation folder Rename
the file to libdvdcss.dll and restart HandBrake
