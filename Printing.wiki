Printing from Vim is not like any other application since it has both console
(Vim) and desktop (GVim) versions running off the same backend. On Linux, it
does not show a Print Dialog, where I can pick the printer and other print
options like number of pages per side, orientation and duplex. So, I print to a
PDF file, open it in a PDF viewer and print from there.

To print to a PDF file from Vim:
1

	:hardcopy > out.pdf

	To print to a PS file from Vim:
	1

	:hardcopy > out.ps
