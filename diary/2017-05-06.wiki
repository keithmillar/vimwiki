MTB's down to Turis for Agricultural and Commercial Fair and of course a coffee, the fair was ok pretty small with local shops and car dealers displaying their stuff.

We meet up with Amanda and Charlotte by Alborache for a walk down by the river. Nice place to walk but too man loose dogs, best time for this walk is a week day.
