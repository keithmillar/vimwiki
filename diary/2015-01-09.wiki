We fitted a new Expansion Vessel to the heating system to day, it looks a bit strange sitting above the boiler but that is the only place for it. Took a long time to bleed the system this time and the pump was full of air. 

After running the heating for a while the pressure valve is no longer acting as the pressure is normal.
