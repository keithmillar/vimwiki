Had to take Lotti to the Vet today, over the course of the last few days she has become increasingly wobbly on her rear legs.

The good news is that her operation appears ok and the screws etc. are all in place, this means that she may have a inflamed and or trapped nerve which is what we are treating her for with anti inflammatory and pain killers.
