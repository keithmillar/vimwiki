Today was a busy day for Flo and I, we had an early call to say the water was
finally ready for collection, so after breakfast Flo and I drove to Saint
Stephen and collected the water and then delivered it back to Tressa mothers
house.

We grabbed a coffee in Kingsbrae Gardens, wandered down town where we had a
beer in the Red Herring, the back to Transition for back racking, and back to
Saint Stephens for the Subway Sandwiches.

Once things settled down a bit Garth finally took time to check out the swim
course, which look fab not a breath of water and Peggy's cove was flat as a
mill pond.
