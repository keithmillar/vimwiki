La Vuelta - Albarcete

Today we drove to Albarcete for a stage of La Vuelta. It was a 2.5hr drive with great scenery although we decided on a more direct route home. 

We got parked about 1km from the stage finish and after lunch we staked out our place just on the 50 mtrs to go sign. We watched the last 35km on a big screen and took as many free bees from the cavalcade as we could, the riders flashed by in a blur, with Nasa Buhama taking the win. On the way back to the car we got his photo and Flo also got Dan Martins.
