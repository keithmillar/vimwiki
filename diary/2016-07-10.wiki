Race Day has finally arrived and the weather is miserable cool, wet and at 03:00
dark. We got roped into distributing the timing chips no problem except I
couldn,t read the numbers on the wrist bands but we managed ok as most of the
competitors where too nervous to notice my short comings.

At 06:30 we zoomed of to Tim Hortons for the volunteer coffee, getting back in
time to watch the swim start at 07:00 then on to the Highway to assume our
marshalling posts. 

I really enjoyed the bike leg of the race everyone was in good form in spite of
the nasty weather, and no crashes even with our turn being very tight.

Once we finished our marshalling we spent the rest of the day watching some of
the runners finish did some tiding up and went to the prize giving dinner which
also turned into a good evening.
