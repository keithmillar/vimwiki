==== CV-4290 ====
Today turned out much better than I could have hoped for, Flo, Amanda and myself headed of to Bunol via Turis, Alborache, Macastre and Yatova. Before we reached Bunol we turned Left on to the vv 4032 14km of perfect road going nowhere built at a cost of €1.2 millon even came with some ice today, once the road turned it gravel track we turned round and froze on the long decent into Bunol. Here got a coffee and a sandwich then back by Godelleta. Flo done really well not fading all day.
