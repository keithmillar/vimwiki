McCool Hikers

Parked in Holywood and joined up with the group and we set off to Bangor, the pace was brisk today which was nice. The wind was on our backs which was just as well as it was very strong.

We stopped in Crawfordsburn Country Park for a coffee and a break where we bumped into Paul Ferguson and this two Children so we did a bit of catching up with him before setting off again to Bangor.

We made good time, so I headed off to the train to collect Blu and the group went to make a donation to the Samaritans Then back to Ards for Fish and Chips.
