McCool Hikers
																	 After meeting G&H on Friday evening we stayed with Judi and did some catching up.

Sat morning was dull windy and very mild 18c at 07:30, after breakfast we headed into Phoenix park heavy traffic and going the wrong way meant we where late and missed the group arrival, however after much searching we gave up and went and watched the start of the race.

As the rain started on cue at 09.55 we watched the race start, we then moved down to mile 6 where we finally saw Garth then Helena.	The three of us wandered around to the coffee shop and enjoyed a nice coffee and cake in the dry archway.

We then found Garth at the Papal Cross and slowly we caught up with the rest of the group.

Because the weather was so nasty we decided not to go back to Dublin and just head home.
