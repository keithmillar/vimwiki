Parcel farce finally got round to delivering or Kiravan's order just before lunch, so Flo an I stripped out the seat and relocated the electrics.

When the order arrived we had only to cut 5mm off the original bolts and the new seat swivel fitted perfectly. We also made a insert to stop dirt etc. from getting into the swivel mechanism.
