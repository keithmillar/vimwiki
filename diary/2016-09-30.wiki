McCool Hikers

Arrived Carrick-a-Rede just before the Bus at 09:30. The hikers all disappeared over to the rope bridge while we took it easy in the coffee shop. It was 11:30 before all our group was ready to go walking, with some people heading to Bushmills Distillery, so only 10 of us headed off on the Causeway Coastal Path.

A bit cooler today but ideal for walking, cool to start and warming up as the day went on and lots of sun. The pace was nice and easy which suited nicely, we stopped for a quick break in Dunseverick Harbour, and then on to The Giants Causeway. Lotti seemed to have good day as well running between Flo and I and trying to round up the group.

We had a quick stop on the way home at the Dark Hedges for the Game of Thrones fans.
