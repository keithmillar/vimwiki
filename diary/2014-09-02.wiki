Out for a spin with Flo again today. Trying to find the road from Turis to Chiva was like looking for a needle in a haystack, finaly Flo found it and we had shorter reverse of Sundays run, with Coffee in Monserrat. Today's route was Altury, Turis, Godelleta, Monserrat, Montroy, Real and Turis.

Spent the evening watching a distant thunder storm from the pool, no sound just the light show.
