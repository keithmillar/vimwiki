McCool Hikers

Very wet when we arrived in Castle Ward, but the McCool Hikers bus drive got lost and by the time they arrived the rain had cleared to scattered cloud and became nice and warm.

This played into our hands as it was dry for Flo's Tea and Coffee.

Due to the late arrival we had to shorten today's walk so we followed the perimiter walk part way and then cut off and came straight back to the house.
