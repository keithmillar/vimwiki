Flo and I cycled to Dos Aguis Macastre Alberache Turis with a refuelling stop in Macastre, Flo not dealing well with the heat once again it was 41c at the top of the climbs. The BB started to get noisy again so I stripped it down and gave it a through cleaning .

Tonight we went to Monserat for food and it was good except way too warm in the Mason bar.
