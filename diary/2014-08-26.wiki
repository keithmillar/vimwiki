Banking and Shopping in Torrent and Bonaire with a visit to the train station to see about going into Valencia but we are not sure if we could cope in the heat.

La Font for our evening meal, arrived too early so where forced to have a drink outside while we waited for the restaurant to open. The meal was lovely and great value at â‚¬80 for 3 three course meals and a bottle of wine.
