Need to top the system quite a lot today, but this was the longest it had been off since yesterday so the pressure dropped to zero.
Some minor leeks to look out for, one at the elbow on the vessel pipe and one on the rad in the front room at the window.

Turned on the heating about 22:00 and all seemed ok Radiatiors got very hot, need to work on the flow control
