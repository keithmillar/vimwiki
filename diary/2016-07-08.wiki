The challenge event is starting to feel a bit more real today as we opened
registration and the vendors set up their wares. Flo and I counted the barriers
at the swim and bike transition. Then when Garth was free we check out Bike
course especially the turn on to and off he highway,

Garth dropped us into town at the Honey Bee coffee shop where we chilled out
before walking back to the Hotel.
