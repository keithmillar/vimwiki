Canoeing on the Kennebecasis River today. Hired a car as G&H have a lot going on
today including a T.T tonight in Hampton so to take the pressure off us we got a
car for the day at a cost of $80 and $9 fuel well worth it.

During the course of our trip we spotted Bald Eagles, Osprey, Red-striped
Blackbirds, Musk Rats and an array of dragon flys, not to mention the blood
sucking flies.

Drove to Kingston for coffee and cake after a lunch in Kredlâ€™s Market then back
to Hampton for the start of the 20km T.T.

Started my warm up the temp was 28.9 fell slightly over the course of the
evening, but it was the wind which caused the most problems. Did a not too bad
time considering I was on a borrowed CX bike.

We went back to The Pretentious Pig for a drink, with Garth, Helena, Darrell &
Ellen, mainly to discuss the up coming Ireland Trip.
