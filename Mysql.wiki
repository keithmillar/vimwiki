### To delete unwanted hosts from mythconverge database

mysql> SELECT DISTINCT `hostname` FROM `settings`;

will show you the various hostnames/identifiers with settings.

mysql> DELETE FROM `settings` WHERE `hostname` = 'identifier';

will delete all settings for the machine using the chosen identifier.



### Purge mysql-bin log files

You can either prune by date or by file. For simplicity, I pruned by file. I connected to mysql and ran the following command:

PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'mysqld-bin.000044';

But you could prune by date:

PURGE BINARY LOGS BEFORE '2013-08-24 00:06:00';
