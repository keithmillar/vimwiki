==== Caddy Web Server ====

After creating a systemd service run the following

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Then these commands as necessary:
 * sudo systemctl enable caddy
 * sudo systemctl start caddy
 * sudo systemctl stop caddy
 * sudo systemctl reload caddy (after a config change saves restarting)

The Caddyfile is in /etc/caddy
