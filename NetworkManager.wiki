nmcli dev wifi con "Cafe Hotspot 1" password caffeine name "My cafe"

              creates a new connection named "My cafe" and then connects it to "Cafe Hotspot 1" SSID using "caffeine" password. This is mainly
              useful when connecting to "Cafe Hotspot 1" for the first time. Next time, it is better to use 'nmcli con up id "My cafe"' so that
              the existing connection profile can be used and no additional is created.
