Often times you want to type input expressions and display results in binary or hexadecimal formats. For that, bc allows you switch the numeric base of input or output numbers. Input and output bases are stored in ibase and obase, respectively. The default value of these special variables is 10, and valid values are 2 through 16 (or the value of BC_BASE_MAX environment variable in case of obase). To switch numeric base, all you have to do is to change the values of ibase and obase. ibase=16

In bc, the precision of numbers is stored in a special variable named scale. This variable represents the number of decimal digits after the decimal point. By default, scale is set to 0, which means that all numbers and results and truncated/stored in integers. To adjust the default precision, all you have to do is to change the value of scale variable
scale=4
