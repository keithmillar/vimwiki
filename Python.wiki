Messages for package dev-python/setuptools-1.1.6:

 * It seems that you need to set USE_PYTHON to make sure that legacy
 * packages will be built with respect to PYTHON_TARGETS correctly:

 *      USE_PYTHON='2.7 3.2 3.3'

 * Please note that after changing the USE_PYTHON variable, you may need
 * to run 'python-updater' to rebuild affected packages.

 * For more information on PYTHON_TARGETS and python.eclass
 * compatibility, please see the relevant Wiki article [1].
