# Easy way to create gemset per project using RVM (Example)

Assuming that you are already on your project directory.  
Now run these commands from your CLI.
    
    
    * Step 1: rvm gemset create [name of gemset]  
    * Step 2: rvm --rvmrc [ruby version here]@[name of gemset]  
    * # Note: You can check your current ruby version by running "ruby -v" from your console.
    * Step 3: Refresh your directory. 
    * # You can simply do this by checking out of your directory and going back to that directory again.
    * Step 4: RVM will ask you a simple Yes, No, View, Cancel question. Press Y for yes.
    * Step 5: You're done! Run bundle install.

Live example:

Current directory: Projects/DumbProject |   
Current ruby version: ruby-1.9.3-p327
    
    
    * $ rvm gemset create dumb  
    gemset created dumb   => /Users/awesomeness/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p327@dumb  
    * $ rvm --rvmrc ruby-1.9.3-p327@dumb  
    * $ cd..  
    * $ cd DumbProject  
    * Do you wish to trust '/Users/awesomeness/Projects/DumbProject/.rvmrc'?  
    * Choose v[iew] below to view the contents
    * y[es], n[o], v[iew], c[ancel]> y
    * $ y
    * $ bundle install

Note: rvm gemset empty - will only delete gemsets from current project while in that directory

Note: In this case, i always put .rvmrc file in my global .gitignore file so I don't need to bother every project I fork with pull requests. You can look at this reference on how to set up your global gitignore: <https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files>

**Cleaning Up**

### remove all old versions of the gem
gem cleanup rjb

### choose which ones you want to remove
gem uninstall rjb

### remove version 1.1.9 only
gem uninstall rjb --version 1.1.9

### remove all versions less than 1.3.4
gem uninstall rjb --version '<1.3.4'
