#### Using a data file ####

This reads from reading.csv and inserts it in to post
<ul>
{% for reading in site.data.reading %}
  <li>
    {{ reading.title }} By {{ reading.author }} Finished {{ reading.date-read }}
</a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

This loop loops through a data file called `reading`
*  and sorts it by the front matter variable `date` and than filters
*  the collection with `reverse` in reverse order
*
*  To make it work you first have to assign the data to a new string
*  called `sorted`.
<ul>
    {% assign sorted = (site.data.reading | sort: 'date-read') | reverse %}
    {% for item in sorted %}
    <li>{{ item.title }} By {{ item.author }} Finished {{ item.date-read }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

This take a data file called reading.csv assign it to groups and the groups it by author and pipes it to name and then sorts by name.
{% assign groups = site.data.reading | group_by: "author" | sort: "name" %}
{% for group in groups %}
<h3> {{ group.name }}</h3>
        {% for item in group.items %}
        <ul>
        <li>{{item.title}}</li>
</ul>
                    {%endfor%}
                    {%endfor%}
